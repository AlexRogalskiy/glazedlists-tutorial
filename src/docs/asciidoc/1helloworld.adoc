== Hello World

You're going to create a simple app for browsing an Issuezilla bug database.

The annoying work like loading the issues data into Java has been taken care of by the included `issuezilla.jar` file.
It'll parse an XML file (or stream!) into simple Issue objects.
If you'd prefer, substitute Issuezilla with another data source.

Regardless of what the data looks like, we're going to sort, filter and transform it using Glazed Lists.

First off, you'll write "Hello World" with Glazed Lists by displaying issues data within a `JList`.

=== EventList, like ArrayList

The `EventList` interface extends the familiar `java.util.List` interface.
This means it has the same methods found in ArrayList like add(), set() and remove().

But there are some extra features in EventList:

* *Event listeners*: An EventList fires events when it's modified to keep your GUI models (Swing, SWT, JavaFX) up-to-date. The `EventList` interface contains methods to add and remove event listeners.

* *Concurrency*: `EventList` has locks so you can share it between threads. You can worry about this later on.

In this tutorial we'll conventrate on building a Swing-based application.

=== JList, JComboBox and JTable: Components with models

The Swing UI toolkit uses the Model-View-Controller pattern throughout.
This means you get to separate code for the data from code for the display.

`DefaultEventListModel` is Glazed Lists' implementation of `ListModel`, which provides the data for a `JList`.
The DefaultEventListModel gets all of its data from an EventList, which you supply as a constructor argument.

As you add and/or remove elements to/from your EventList, the DefaultEventListModel updates automatically, and in turn your `JList` updates automatically!

Similarly, `DefaultEventTableModel` will update your `JTable` and `DefaultEventComboBoxModel` takes care of `JComboBox`.

The following diagram gives on overview of the available Swing models.
The class `GlazedListsSwing` provides convenient factory methods for creating these models.

=== A simple issue browser

Now it's time to write some code.
You'll create a `BasicEventList` and populate it with issues.

Next, create a `DefaultEventListModel` and a corresponding `JList`.

Finally you can place it all in a `JFrame` and show that on screen.

[source,java]
.IssueBrowser
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/publicobject/glazedlists/tutorial/chapter1/IssuesBrowser1.java[indent=0]
----
<1> use a `BasicEventList` as source for issues
<2> loaded issues are added to the `BasicEventList`
<3> create the `DefaultEventListModel` with `GlazedListsSwing`-factory method
<4> construct `JList` with the new `ListModel`

NOTE: Glazed Lists provides different variants of factory methods for creating the Swing model classes.
The examples in this tutorial use those factories which internally wrap the source list with a SwingThreadProxyList and use that one as source list for the models.
Those factory methods have WithThreadProxyList in their name.
This way, list events are delivered on the Swing event dispatch thread.
The <<concurrency,Concurrency chapter>> provides some more information.


=== So What?

So far you haven't seen the real benefits of Glazed Lists.
But filtering and sorting are now easy to add.
You can now swap the JList for a JTable without touching your data layer.
Without Glazed Lists, such a change would have you throw out your ListModel code and implement TableModel instead.
