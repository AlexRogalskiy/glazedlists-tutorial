== DefaultEventSelectionModel and Custom Filter Lists

Now that you've got the `JList` displaying issue users, it's just a few steps to make that filter the main issues table.

=== DefaultEventSelectionModel

Along with `ListModel` and `TableModel`, Glazed Lists provides a `ListSelectionModel` that eliminates all of the index manipulation related to selection handling.
`DefaultEventSelectionModel` brings you three advantages over Swing's standard `DefaultListSelectionModel`:

. It publishes an `EventList` containing a live view of the current selection. Access the selected elements like they're in an `ArrayList`.

. It fixes a problem with the standard ListSelectionModel's `MULTIPLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION` mode.
In that mode, rows inserted within the selected range become selected.
This is quite annoying when removing a filter because restored elements become selected.
The fix is in DefaultEventSelectionModel's default selection mode, `MULTIPLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION_DEFENSIVE`.
In this mode, rows must be explicitly selected by your user.

. It provides another improvement in the user experience related to table sorting.
When row selections exist and a table is resorted, `DefaultListSelectionModel` responds by clearing the selections, which is an undesirable reaction.
The reason is that insufficient information exists in a `TableModelEvent` to do anything more intelligent.
But that limitation does not exist with `DefaultEventSelectionModel` because it receives a fine-grained `ListEvent` detailing the reordering.
Consequently, `DefaultEventSelectionModel` is able to preserve row selections after sorts.

You'll enjoy accessing selection from an `EventList`.
For example, you can use the familiar methods `List.isEmpty()` and `List.contains()` in new ways:

[source,java]
----
if (usersSelectedList.isEmpty()) return true;
...
String user = issue.getReporter();
return usersSelectedList.contains(user);
----

=== Custom filtering using Matchers

Just as you've seen `TextComponentMatcherEditor` filter issues with a `JTextField`, you can create a custom `MatcherEditor` to filter with the users `JList`.

The first step is to create a simple `Matcher` for static filtering.
Then we'll create `MatcherEditor` to implement dynamic filtering using our static `Matcher`.

Implementing the `Matcher` will require you to write a single method, `matches()` to test whether a given element should be filtered out.
You'll need to create a `Matcher` that accepts issues for a list of users

WARNING: It's unfortunate that Glazed Lists' Matcher uses the same class name as `java.util.regex.Matcher`.
If you find yourself implementing a Glazed Lists Matcher that requires regular expressions, you'll need to fully qualify classnames throughout your code, and we apologize.
We considered 'Predicate' for the interface name but decided it was too presumptuous.
Naming is very important to us at Glazed Lists!

[source,java]
.IssuesForUsersMatcher
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/publicobject/glazedlists/tutorial/chapter5/IssuesForUsersMatcher.java[indent=0]
----

With this `IssuesForUsersMatcher` in place, create an `EventList` that contains the issues that match only the specified users:

[source,java]
----
List<String> users = Arrays.asList("jessewilson", "kevinmaltby", "tmao");
Matcher<Issue> usersMatcher = new IssuesForUsersMatcher(users);
 
EventList<Issue> issues = ...
FilterList<Issue> issuesForUsers = new FilterList<>(issues, usersMatcher);
----

TIP: To avoid concurrency problems, make your Matchers immutable.
This enables your `matches()` method to be used from multiple threads without synchronization.

=== Dynamic filtering using MatcherEditors

Static filtering with just Matchers means that the filtering logic is fixed. 
We need the filtering logic to change as the selection in the users list changes.
For this, there's `MatcherEditor`.

It provides the mechanics for FilterLists to observe changes to the filtering logic.
In your `MatcherEditor` implementation, you change the filtering logic by creating a new Matcher that implements the new logic.
Then fire an event to all listening MatcherEditorListeners.
You can implement this quickly by extending our `AbstractMatcherEditor`.
To implement the users filter, create an `IssuesForUsersMatcher` each time the selection changes.
Then notify all your MatcherEditor's listeners using the method `fireChanged()` inherited from `AbstractMatcherEditor`.


[source,java]
.UsersSelect
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/publicobject/glazedlists/tutorial/chapter5/UsersSelect.java[indent=0]
----
<1> exend `AbstractMatcherEditor` to simplify implementation
<2> observe changes to the selection in the user list
<3> on selection change create new `IssuesForUsersMatcher` with the currently selected user names
<4> fire an change event to all listening MatcherEditorListeners, e.g. the `FilterList`

Configure the new `MatcherEditor` to be used by your `FilterList`:

[source,java]
----
EventList<Issue> issues = ...
UsersSelect usersSelect = new UsersSelect(issues);
FilterList<Issue> userFilteredIssues = new FilterList<>(issues, usersSelect);
----

TIP: While the `eventSelectionModel` factory method creates an instance of `DefaultEventSelectionModel`, its return type is the interface `AdvancedListSelectionModel`.
Itâ€™s an extension of the standard `ListSelectionModel` and is implemented by `DefaultEventSelectionModel`.

=== So What?

You've exploited advanced Glazed Lists functionality to build a user filter.
First with _static filtering_ using a `Matcher`, then _dynamic filtering_ by creating instances of that `Matcher` from a `MatcherEditor`.
