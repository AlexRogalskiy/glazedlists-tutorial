== Sorting, Tables & Sorting Tables

Now that you've got "Hello World" out of the way, it's time to see Glazed Lists shine.
You'll upgrade the `JList` to a `JTable` and let your users sort by clicking on the column headers.

=== SortedList, a list transformation

`SortedList` is a decorator that shows a source `EventList` in sorted order.

Every `TransformedList` including `SortedList` listens for change events from a source `EventList`.
When that source is changed, the `TransformedList` changes itself in response.

By layering TransformedLists like `SortedList` and `FilterList` you can create flexible and powerful programs with ease.

=== Comparators, Comparable and SortedList

To sort in Java, you must compare elements that are `Comparable` or create an external `Comparator`.
By creating a Comparator or implementing Comparable, we gain full control of the sort order of our elements.

For the `Issue` class, you can sort using the `priority` property:

[source,java]
.IssueComparator that compares by priority
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/publicobject/glazedlists/tutorial/chapter2/IssueComparator.java[indent=0]
----

[TIP]
====
With _Java 8+_ you can also use helper functions of `Comparator` to define comparators:

[source,java]
----
Comparator<Issue> issueComparator = Comparator.comparing(Issue::getPriority);
----

This works, because `Priority` implements `Comparable` as needed.
====

Now that you can compare elements, create a `SortedList` using the issues `EventList` and the `IssueComparator`.
The `SortedList` will provide a sorted view of the issues list.
It keeps the issues sorted dynamically as the source EventList changes.

[source,java]
.Create SortedList with comparator

=== Using TableFormat to specify columns

Although the `DefaultEventTableModel` takes care of the table's rows, you must specify columns.
This includes how many columns, their names, and how to get the column value from an `Issue` object.

To specify columns, implement the `TableFormat` interface. The `IssueTableFormat` shows how to do this for `Issue` elements:

[source,java]
.IssueTableFormat
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/publicobject/glazedlists/tutorial/chapter2/IssueTableFormat.java[indent=0]
----

TIP: There are a few mixin interfaces that allow you to do more with your table:
`WritableTableFormat` allows you to make your `JTable` editable.
`AdvancedTableFormat` allows you to specify the class and a `Comparator` for each column, for use with specialized renderers and `TableComparatorChooser`.

=== The DefaultEventTableModel and TableComparatorChooser

With your columns prepared, replace the `JList` with a `JTable`.
This means exchanging the `DefaultEventListModel` with a `DefaultEventTableModel`, which requires your `IssueTableFormat` for its constructor.

The `SortedList` is the data source for the `DefaultEventTableModel`.
Although it's initially sorted by priority, your users will want to reorder the table by clicking on the column headers.
For example, clicking on the "Type" header shall sort the issues by type.
For this, Glazed Lists provides `TableComparatorChooser`, which adds sorting to a `JTable` using your `SortedList`.

[source,java]
.Display a sortable table
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/publicobject/glazedlists/tutorial/chapter2/IssuesBrowser2.java[indent=0,tags=Display]
----

NOTE: While the `eventTableModel` factory method creates an instance of `DefaultEventTableModel`, its return type is the interface `AdvancedTableModel`.
Itâ€™s an extension of the standard `TableModel` and is implemented by `DefaultEventTableModel`.

NOTE: `TableComparatorChooser` supports both single column sorting (simpler) and multiple column sorting (more powerful).
This is configured by the third argument in the constructor. 

WARNING: By default, `TableComparatorChooser` sorts by casting column values to `Comparable`.
If your column's values are not `Comparable`, you'll have to manually remove the default Comparator using `tableSorter.getComparatorsForColumn(column).clear()`.

=== So What?

Now you have built an issue table, that is sortable by clicking on the desired column headers. Next, we'll add filtering!
