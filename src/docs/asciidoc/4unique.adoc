== TransformedList and UniqueList

In part four of this tutorial, you will derive a list of users from your issues `EventList`. Once you have a list of users, you can use that to filter the main issues list.

=== TransformedList and ListEventAssembler

ListEvents are sophisticated objects, providing fine-grained details on each insert, update and delete to your `EventList`.
To simplify the process, `ListEventAssembler` manages ListEvents and ListEventListeners for you:

* It provides natural methods like `addInsert(index)`, `addUpdate(index)` and `addDelete(index)` which map to `List.add()`, `set()` and `remove()`.

* To group multiple changes into a single `ListEvent`, there's `beginEvent()` and `commitEvent()`.

* For your convenience, you can fire an event identical to that which was received using `forwardEvent()`.


=== TransformedList and ListEvents

Each of the issues contains a 'reported by' user.
With the appropriate transformation, you can create an `EventList` of users from that `EventList` of issues.
As issues list is changed, the users list changes automatically.
If your first issue's user is "jessewilson", then the first element in the derived users list will be "jessewilson".
There will be a simple one-to-one relationship between the issues list and the users list.

For this kind of arbitrary list transformation, extend the abstract `TransformedList`.
By overriding the `get()` method to return an issue's user rather than the issue itself, you make the issues list look like a users list!

We're required to write some boilerplate code to complete our users list transformation:

* Second, when the source `EventList` changes, we forward an equivalent event to our listeners as well.
This is taken care of by calling `updates.forwardEvent()` within the `listChanged()` method.

<1> extend `TransformedList` to implement a custom list transformation
<2> observe the source issues list by registering an event listener
<3> apply the transformation from issue to user
<4> when the source `EventList` changes, we forward an equivalent event to our listeners as well
<5> this `TransformedList` is not modifiable

=== Eliminating duplicates with UniqueList

Although the issues list contains over 100 issues, there's only a few unique users.
Our users list has many duplicates - one for each occurrence of a user in the issues list.
Duplicate removal is solved quickly and easily by `UniqueList`.

Finally, you can display the users list in a `JList`.
In the next chapter, we'll use that `JList` in a filter for our issues list.
