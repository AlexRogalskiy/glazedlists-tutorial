== Concurrency

Concurrency support is built right into the central interface of Glazed Lists, `EventList`.
This may seem like mixing unrelated concerns, but the advantages are worth it:

* Populate your user interface components from a background thread without having to use `SwingUtilities.invokeLater()`

* You can rely on explicit locking policies - you have to worry that you're calling synchronize on the wrong object!

* Glazed Lists provides means to queue updates to the Swing event dispatch thread when the source of the change is a different thread.

* Filtering and sorting can be performed in the background

NOTE: If your EventLists are used by only one thread, you don't need to worry about locking.

=== Read/Write Locks

Every `EventList` has a method `getReadWriteLock()` that should be used for threadsafe access.
Read/Write locks are designed to allow access by multiple readers or a single writer.
The locks in Glazed Lists are reentrant which allows you to lock multiple times before you unlock.
To read from an `EventList` that is shared with another thread:

[source,java]
----
EventList myList = ...
myList.getReadWriteLock().readLock().lock();
try {
    // perform read operations like myList.size() and myList.get()
} finally {
    myList.getReadWriteLock().readLock().unlock();
}
----

To write to a shared `EventList`:

[source,java]
----
EventList myList = ...
myList.getReadWriteLock().writeLock().lock();
try {
    // perform write operations like myList.set() and myList.clear()
} finally {
    myList.getReadWriteLock().writeLock().unlock();
}
----

=== GlazedLists.threadSafeList

Glazed Lists provides a thread safe `EventList` that you can use without calling `lock()` and `unlock()` for each access.
Wrap your `EventList` using the factory method `GlazedLists.threadSafeList()`.
Unfortunately, this method has its drawbacks:

* Performing a `lock()` and `unlock()` for every method call can hurt performance.

* Your `EventList` may change between adjacent calls to the thread safe decorator.

=== The Swing Event Dispatch Thread

Swing requires that all user interface access be performed by the event dispatch thread.
You won't have to worry when you're using Glazed Lists, however.

By using the appropriate factory methods as shown in this tutorial, the model adapter classes automatically use a special EventList that copies your list changes to the Swing event dispatch thread.
If you need, you can create instances of this proxy list yourself by using the factory method `GlazedListsSwing.swingThreadProxyList(EventList)`.

Here are the two possibilities side by side:

[source,java]
----
// option 1: call the appropriate factory method to let GLazed Lists create the proxy list
EventList<Issue> sourceIssues = ...
AnvancedTableModel<Issue> issuesTableModel =
GlazedListsSwing.eventTableModelWithThreadProxyList(sourceIssues, new IssueTableFormat());

// option 2: create the proxy list yorself
EventList<Issue> sourceIssues = ...
EventList<Issue> threadProxyList = GlazedListsSwing.swingThreadProxyList(sourceIssues);
AnvancedTableModel<Issue> issuesTableModel =
GlazedListsSwing.eventTableModel(threadProxyList, new IssueTableFormat());
----

While _option 1_ is more convenient, _option 2_ is more flexible.
For example, you could use your own implementation of a `ThreadProxyList` for special needs.

When your code accesses `DefaultEventTableModel` and other Swing classes it must do so only from the Swing event dispatch thread.
For this you can use the `SwingUtilities.invokeLater()` method.

=== Multithreading our IssuesBrowser

Adding background loading support to our `IssuesBrowser` isn't too tough.
Create a `Thread` that loads the issues XML from a file or web service and populates the issues `EventList` with the result.
The provided issue XML parser provides a callback `issueLoaded()` which allows you to show each issue as it arrives.

[source,java]
.IssuesLoader
----

----

You'll also need to make `IssuesBrowser` threadsafe:

* The Swing components should be constructed on the event dispatch thread.
Using `SwingUtilities.invokeLater()` can accomplish this.

* The constructors for `SortedList` and our FilterLists require that we have acquired the source EventList's read lock.

You've exploited concurrency to simultaneously load and display data.
