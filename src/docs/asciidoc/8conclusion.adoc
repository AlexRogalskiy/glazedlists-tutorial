== Conclusion

In this tutorial you saw how to incrementally build a Swing-based application to present issue data, that can be dynamically sorted and filtered by different criteria. 

By applying the list transformations and Swing model adapters provided by Glazed Lists, we were able to build a responsive UI with managable effort.

Similar tasks can be accomplished for JavaFX- or SWT-based applications as well.

We hope you enjoyed this tutorial and got an impression what Glazed Lists can do for you.

Stay tuned for more exiting stuff!
