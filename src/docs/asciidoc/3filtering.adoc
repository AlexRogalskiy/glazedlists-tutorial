== Text Filtering

With all issues on screen it's already time to remove some of them!
Your users can filter the table simply by entering words into a `JTextField`, just like in _Apple iTunes_.
Text filtering is a fast and easy way to find a needle in a haystack!

=== TextFilterator

You need to tell Glazed Lists which Strings to filter against for each element in your `EventList`.

Implement the `TextFilterator` interface by adding all the relevant Strings from an `Issue` to the List provided.

[source,java]
.IssueTextFilterator
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/publicobject/glazedlists/tutorial/chapter3/IssueTextFilterator.java[indent=0]
----

NOTE: The `getFilterStrings()` method is awkward because the List of Strings is a parameter rather than the return type.
This approach allows Glazed Lists to skip creating an `ArrayList` each time the method is invoked.
We're generally averse to this kind of micro-optimization.
In this case this performance improvement is worthwhile because the method is used heavily while filtering.

=== FilterList, Matcher, and MatcherEditor

To do filtering you'll need:

. A `FilterList`, a `TransformedList` that filters elements from a source `EventList`. As the source changes, `FilterList` observes the change and updates itself automatically.

. An implementation of the `Matcher` interface, which instructs `FilterList` whether to include or exclude a given element from the source EventList.

This is all you'll need to do _static_ filtering - the filtering criteria doesn't ever change.

When you need to do _dynamic_ filtering you'll need a `MatcherEditor`.
This interface allows you to fire events each time the filtering criteria changes.
The `FilterList` responds to that change and notifies its listeners in turn.

TIP: The main difference between Matchers and MatcherEditors is that Matchers should be immutable whereas MatcherEditors can be dynamic.
The motivation for the distinction lies in thread safety.
If Matchers were mutable, filtering threads and Matcher editing threads could interfere with one another.

=== Adding the FilterList and a TextComponentMatcherEditor

The `FilterList` works with any `Matcher` or `MatcherEditor`.

In this case, we'll use a `TextComponentMatcherEditor`.
It accepts any `JTextComponent` for editing the filter text - in most cases you'll use a `JTextField`.

Creating the `FilterList` and getting your `DefaultEventTableModel` to use it takes only a few lines of new code:

[source,java]
.Display sortable and *filterable* table

include::{sourcedir}/com/publicobject/glazedlists/tutorial/chapter3/IssuesBrowser3.java[indent=0,tags=Display]

=== So What?

You've added filtering that's independent of sorting, display and changes in your data.
